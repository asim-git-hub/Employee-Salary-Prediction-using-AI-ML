# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using AI & ML

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict employee salaries based on HR features from a real-world dataset. Developed during the Edunet Internship Program.

## 📌 Problem Statement
To build a predictive model that estimates employee salaries using various factors like department, performance, demographics, and work behavior.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Ngrok (for deployment)

## 🧠 ML Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Regression
- XGBoost Regressor

## 📊 Key Features
- Complete preprocessing pipeline
- Model training & evaluation
- Real-time salary prediction via Streamlit app
- Interactive dashboard (with filters, charts, predictions)

## 📈 Best Model
🏆 **XGBoost** achieved the highest R² Score of **0.55** with RMSE of **~18,897**
